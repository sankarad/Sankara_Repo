LEX 18 - Thursday April 12

OVERVIEW
--------
In this lab exercise you will be working with the memcheck tool from
the valgrind suite.  In class yesterday we explored several errors
that memcheck can detect, and discussed what code problems can give
rise to them.  In this exercise you get to explore memory problems in
some code, with the goal being to resolve them.

The exercise is split into two parts, partA and partB.  The code for
each part is its own directory.  Start with partA and then move on to
partB.

Apply good development and debugging practices, including use of a
repo in BitBucket and branching as appropriate.  When you run
valgrind, use either of these forms:

	  valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes -v ./main 
	  valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes ./main 

You may incorporate these into targets in the makefiles to make
running the code easier.


PART A
------
 
The first thing to do is to compile and run the code:

    make main
    ./main

What output is produced?

RESPONSE 1:


Run the exectuable using valgrind:

    valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes ./main 

Study the section of the output dealing with memory leaks.  You should
see a table like that looks like this:

==31698== LEAK SUMMARY:
==31698==    definitely lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==31698==    indirectly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==31698==      possibly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==31698==    still reachable: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==31698==         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks

Your table should have some non-zero byte and block counts.  Show your
table here:

RESPONSE 2:


Explain, in your own words, what the non-zerp byte and block counts
refer to.  You may consult the valgrind documentation
(e.g. http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/faq.html#faq.deflost).  Do not
simply copy text from the documentation - rephrase using your own
words.

RESPONSE 3:


You will notice in the IntList.c file that the function deleteIntList
has an empty definition.  Define this function so that it deletes the
IntList it points to (including the IntNodes that it contains).

After you define this function, check the LEAK SUMMARY again
(reproducing the results below):

RESPONSE 4:


You may find memory is still being leaked.  Do your best to get down
to zero memory leaks.  If you have not eliminated the leaks by the
midpoint of the lab, give your last LEAK SUMMARY report, and continue
with Part B.


PART B
------
  
The first thing to do is to compile and run the code:

    make main
    ./main

What output is produced?

RESPONSE 5:


Run the exectuable using valgrind:

    valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes ./main 

Study the section of the output dealing with memory leaks.  You should
see a table like that looks like this:

==31698== LEAK SUMMARY:
==31698==    definitely lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==31698==    indirectly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==31698==      possibly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==31698==    still reachable: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==31698==         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks

Your table should have some non-zero byte and block counts.  Show your
table here:

RESPONSE 6:


In this part you will notice, in the StringList.c file, that the
function deleteStringList has a definition.  However, it may not be
correct and complete.  Don't change it for now (that comes later), but
for now notice that in main.c there are three commented out calls to
this function, as in:

  /* DELETE #1 */
  //  deleteStringList(evenStrings);

Comment in the first call, labelled with /* DELETE #1 */, then
recompile and rerun memcheck:

    make clean
    make main
    valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes ./main 

Show your LEAK SUMMARY table here:

RESPONSE 7:
    

Do the same with the call labelled with /* DELETE #2 */.  Show your LEAK SUMMARY table here:

RESPONSE 8:
    

Do the same with the call labelled with /* DELETE #3 */.  Show your LEAK SUMMARY table here:

RESPONSE 9:
    


deleteStringList does not delete the StringList struct that getRest
creates.  Modify deleteStringList so it also deletes this structure.
Give your revised definition here:

RESPONSE 10:
    

Recompile, show your LEAK SUMMARY table here:

RESPONSE 11:
    


OK - now let's think about another aspect to what this function could
do: should deleteStringList also delete the data (the strings) the
list holds?  Notice that this is a little problematic as allStrings
shares contents with boththe evenStrings list and the oddStrings list.

Define deleteStringList so it also deletes the strings contained in
the list, not just the list structure.  Recompile, show your LEAK
SUMMARY table here:

RESPONSE 12:
    


Does this change cause other problems in the code (e.g. unintended
output, or read/write errors reported by valgrind?)


RESPONSE 13:


You may find memory is still being leaked.  Do your best to get down
to zero memory leaks.  If you have not eliminated the leaks by the
endpoint of the lab, give your last LEAK SUMMARY report, zip and
submit.   Also be sure to commit and push to your Bitbucket repo.

RESPONSE 14:


That's it - well done!
